# Bachelor-thesis

This repository is the product of Tobias V. R. Jensen's Bachelor thesis and is part of the Appendix for the report. 

The repository is build on Matthias Wiesenberger's Feltor library, where the main part comes from the advection repository:

The major difference is in the "OneDimensional.ipynb" in the advection folder, but some changes were made to "plasma.cpp" as well (Also in the advetion folder). 
Another relevant file is the "feltorutilities" in the feltorutilities folder. 
The folders containing these files is all that is uploaded to this repository. The full library also consists of the following folders:
