    " where we have Gyro-Bohm normalization and $\\mu_e = -m_e/m_i$, $\\mu_i = 1$, $\\tau_e = -1$ and $\\tau_i = T_i / T_e$. Further, \n",

    " \\Omega_{ce} / \\nu_{ei,0}$ and $\\nu_{u,i} = 0.96 \\Omega_{ci} / \\nu_{ii,0}$. Last, we have the Debye parameter $\\epsilon_D = \\lambda_D^2 / \\rho_s^2$ with the Debye length $\\lambda_D$ and the\n",
    " ion gyro-radius at electron temperature $\\rho_s$. Note that we choose the peculiar signs in $\\mu_e$ and $\\tau_e$ such that the electron and ion momentum equations have exactly the same form, which makes it easy to implement.\n",
    " \n",
    " Also note that we choose Bohm normalization based on gyro-radius $\\rho_s$ and gyro-frequency $\\Omega_{ci}$  because this is how we normalize the three-dimensional model. However, there is no magnetic field in the model and so the gyration does not appear. The more natural normalisation uses plasma frequency and Debye length, which makes the $\\epsilon_D$ parameter disappear {cite}`Sack1987`. \n",

    "ion continuity and ion momentum equations thus decouple from the system and yield the Navier Stokes equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adiabatic electrons\n",
    "In the limit of $\\mu_e=0$ and vanishing resistivity $\\eta =0$\n",
    "the electron force balance reduces to $\\partial_x n_e = n_e \\partial_x\\phi$ which is solved by $n_e = n_{e,0}\\exp(\\phi)$. \n",
